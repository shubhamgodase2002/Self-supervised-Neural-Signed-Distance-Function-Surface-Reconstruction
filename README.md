# Self-supervised Neural Signed Distance Function Model For Surface Reconstruction

This repository contains the full project files, report, poster, and demonstration animations for a self-supervised neural framework that reconstructs 3D surfaces directly from unstructured point clouds using Signed Distance Functions (SDFs).

## üöÄ Project Overview

Reconstructing accurate 3D surfaces from sparse, noisy point cloud data remains a significant challenge, especially without supervision or mesh connectivity.  
This project implements a self-supervised Signed Distance Function (SDF) learning pipeline using Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIREN), which:

- Learns continuous SDF from point clouds without ground-truth supervision.
- Incorporates multiple geometric losses (Eikonal, Dirichlet, Non-Matching, Neumann, Hessian).
- Uses marching cubes for watertight mesh reconstruction.
- Demonstrates high reconstruction accuracy across CAD-like and complex biological geometries.

## üß† Model Architecture

- **Network:** 6-layer MLP (4 hidden layers √ó 256 neurons)
- **Activation:** Sinusoidal activation (œâ‚ÇÄ = 30)
- **Optimizer:** Adam (`lr=1e-5`)
- **Training:** 10,000 epochs
- **Loss Functions:**  
    - Eikonal Loss  
    - Dirichlet Matching Loss  
    - Dirichlet Non-Matching Loss  
    - Alignment Loss  
    - Neumann Loss  
    - Singular Hessian Loss

## üîß Pipeline Workflow

1. Load Point Cloud (STL/OBJ models)
2. Data Preparation (Surface points P, near-surface Œ©, far-field Q)
3. Neural SDF Learning with SIREN
4. Custom Loss Functions applied
5. Model Training
6. Surface Reconstruction (Marching Cubes)
7. Evaluation (Chamfer Distance, F-Score, Normal Consistency)
